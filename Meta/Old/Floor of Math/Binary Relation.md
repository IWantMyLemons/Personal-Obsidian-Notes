Definition:: Given sets $A$ and $B$, a binary relation $R:A\to B$ where $R \subseteq A \times B$

## Notation
Binary relations are normally marked by the letter $R$ :
$aRb = (a,b)\subseteq R$
$a\not Rb = (a,b)\not\subseteq R$

### Examples
$xRy = (x,y)\subseteq R$
$2Rb = (2,b)\subseteq R$
$\pi \not R c = (\pi,x)\not\subseteq R$
