Definition:: Limits by thinking

If we take
$$
g(x) = \frac{x^3-1}{x-1}
$$
and put into a table, we can attempt to approach it's value

| x | f(x) |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1.1 | 3.31 |
| 1.01 | 3.0301 |
| 1.001 | 3.003001 |
| 1 | ? |
| 0.999 | 2.997001 |
| 0.99 | 2.9701 |
| 0.9 | 2.71 |
Here we see that the value approaching $1$ is probably $3$, doing it like this is the first way limits were done, just think about it lmao
