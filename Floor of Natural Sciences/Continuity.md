Definition:: Happens when a function's limit equals to it's function result

$$
\lim_{x\to a}{f(x)}=f(a)
$$
While a limit exists, it's still possible for the value of a limit to be different from simply plugging it in the formula. In the case where the limit is not equal to the function, it is called not continuous. 

## Directional Continuity
A function can be continuous from the right if
$$
\lim_{x\to a^+}{f(x)}=f(a)
$$
A function can be continuous from the left if
$$
\lim_{x\to a^-}{f(x)}=f(a)
$$
