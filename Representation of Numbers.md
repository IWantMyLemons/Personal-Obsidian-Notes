Definition:: base of a number, normally noteated with a subscript so $15_{10}$ = $1111_2$

Numbers are normally represented with a base, normally people use base 10 or also known as decimal. Numbers in each base can be written as a long ass formula:
$154.23_{10} = 1 \times 10^2 + 5 \times 10^1 + 4 \times 10^0 + 2 \times 10^{-1} + 3 \times 10^{-2}$

Other than decimal there is also:
- [Binary](./Binary.md) (Base 2)
- Octal (Base 8)
- Hexadecimal (Base 16)
- [Floating Point Notation](./Floating%20Point%20Notation.md)
