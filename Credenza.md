## TODO
- [Plane](./Plane.md): Do more research on how this works, maybe write a note on [Quaternion](Quaternion.md)


## Recent
- [Linked List](./Linked%20List.md): a way of storing data where elements are grouped with a pointer to the next one
- [Binary Tree](./Binary%20Tree.md): each node has a left pointer and a right pointer
- [Queue](./Queue.md): a group of group of elements following "first in **first** out"
- [Stack](./Stack.md): a group of group of elements following "first in **last** out"
- [Data Structures](./Data%20Structures.md): The implementation of an [Abstract Data Type](Abstract%20Data%20Type.md)
- [Array](./Array.md): A collection of data elements placed next to eachother
- [Credenza](Credenza.md): Totally not Impuritas Civitatis
- [Absolute Error](./Absolute%20Error.md): $|E_t| = |\text{true value} - \text{approximation}|$, true error but absoluted
- [Approximation Error](./Approximation%20Error.md): $e_\alpha=\text{Approximation 1} - \text{Approximation 2}$
